----- Description -----

Javascript based web game mini-project 

----- Content -----

HTML: to provide an interface for users while playing the game

Javascript: responsible for all the game's logic

----- Progression -----

22/02/2023 - Creating the game
-Basic html boilerplate established 
-javascript functions implemented for player choice, bot choice, events per round and entire game points

Plans for improvement:
- Refactoring of functions is essential as varaible and expression repetition is at all time high!
- validation check of the input (check if null || undefined || unrelated answer) to leave the loop earlier (save time and RAM)
- simple html and css webpage interface needed (will need to revisit DOM manipulation)
